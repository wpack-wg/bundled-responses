Abstract

   Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses, with
   the request URLs that produced them, to transmit or store together.
   They can include multiple top-level resources, provide random access
   to their component exchanges, and efficiently store 8-bit resources.

1.  Introduction

   To satisfy the use cases in [I-D.yasskin-wpack-use-cases], this
   document proposes a new bundling format to group HTTP resources.  The
   format is structured as an initial table of "sections" within the
   bundle followed by the content of those sections.

1.1.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the conventions and terminology defined in
   the Infra Standard ([INFRA]).

2.  Semantics

   A bundle is logically a set of HTTP representations (Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics]), themselves represented by HTTP
   response messages (Section 3.4 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics]).  The
   bundle can include optional metadata, which may be required by
   particular applications.

   While the order of the representations is not semantically
   meaningful, it can significantly affect performance when the bundle
   is loaded from a network stream.

2.1.  Operations

   Bundle parsers support two primary operations:

   1.  They can load the bundle's metadata given a prefix of the bundle.

   2.  They can find a representation within the bundle given that
       representation's URL (Section 2.2).

2.2.  Naming a representation

   Representations within a bundle are named by their "Content-Location"
   (Section 8.7 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics]).  This is also known as
   the representation's URL.  It is either an absolute-URI or a partial-
   URI (Section 2.7 of [RFC7230]).  In the latter case, the referenced
   URL is relative to the bundle's URL unless an additional section in
   the bundle specifies a different base URL.

   This identifying information for each representation is stored in an
   index (Section 4.2.1) rather than in that representation's HTTP
   response message.

3.  Expected performance

   Bundles can be used in two different situations: they can be loaded
   from storage that provides O(1) access to any byte within the bundle,
   or they can be sent across a stream that provides bytes
   incrementally.  An implementation MAY prefer either or both
   situations and SHOULD provide the following performance
   characteristics in its preferred situations:

3.1.  Random access

   To load a resource when seeing a bundle for the first time, the
   implementation reads O(size of the metadata and resource index)
   before starting to return bytes of the resource.

   TODO: Is big-O notation the right way to express expectations here?

3.2.  Streaming

   When sending a bundle over a stream, the implementation will need to
   wait until it has the sizes of all contained resources before
   starting to send the resource index.

   When reading a bundle from a stream, the implementation starts
   returning bytes of a resource after receiving O(1) bytes of that
   resource, which comes after the O(# of resources) bytes of the index.

4.  Format

4.1.  Top-level structure

   A bundle is a CBOR array ([CBORbis]) with the following CDDL ([CDDL])
   schema:

   webbundle = [
     magic: h'F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6',
     version: bytes .size 4,
     section-lengths: bytes .cbor section-lengths,
     sections: [* any ],
     length: bytes .size 8,  ; Big-endian number of bytes in the bundle.
   ]

   whatwg-url = tstr

   When serialized, the bundle MUST satisfy the core deterministic
   encoding requirements from Section 4.2.1 of [CBORbis].  This format
   does not use floating point values or tags, so this specification
   does not add any deterministic encoding rules for them.  If an item
   doesn't follow these requirements, or a byte-sequence being decoded
   as a CBOR item contains extra bytes, the parser MUST signal an error
   instead of any data it can extract from that item.

   High-level fields in the bundle format are designed to provide their
   length-in-bytes before the field starts so that a recipient trying to
   stream a bundle from the network can always wait for a known number
   of bytes instead of needing to implement a streaming CBOR parser.

   The "magic" number is "🌐📦" (U+1F310 U+1F4E6) encoded in UTF-8.  With
   the CBOR initial bytes for the array and bytestring, this makes the
   format identifiable by looking for "8? 48" (in base 16) followed by
   that UTF-8 encoding.  Parsers MUST only check the initial nibble of
   the initial "8?" byte in order to accommodate any future version's
   change in the number of array elements (up to 15).

   The "version" bytestring MUST be "31 00 00 00" in base 16 (an ASCII
   "1" followed by 3 0s) for this version of bundles.  If the recipient
   doesn't support the version in this field, it MUST ignore the bundle.

   The "section-lengths" and "sections" arrays contain the actual
   content of the bundle and are defined in Section 4.2.  The "section-
   lengths" array is embedded in a byte string to facilitate reading it
   from a network.  This byte string MUST be less than 8192 (8*1024)
   bytes long, and parsers MUST NOT load any data from a "section-
   lengths" item longer than this.

   The bundle ends with an 8-byte integer holding the length of the
   whole bundle.

4.1.1.  Trailing length

   A bundle ends with an 8-byte CBOR byte string holding a big-endian
   integer that represents the byte-length of the whole bundle.

    +------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    | first byte | ... | 48 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | BC | 61 | 4E |
    +------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                /       \
          0xBC614E-10=12345668 omitted bytes

                      Figure 1: Example trailing bytes

   Recipients loading the bundle in a random-access context SHOULD start
   by reading the last 8 bytes and seeking backwards by that many bytes
   to find the start of the bundle, instead of assuming that the start
   of the file is also the start of the bundle.  This allows the bundle
   to be appended to another format such as a generic self-extracting
   executable.

4.1.2.  Draft version numbers

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   Implementations of drafts of this specification MUST NOT use a
   "version" string of "31 00 00 00" (base 16).  They MUST instead
   define an implementation-specific 4-byte string starting with "62"
   ("b") to identify which draft is implemented.

4.2.  Bundle sections

   A bundle's content is in a series of sections, which can be accessed
   randomly using the information in the "section-lengths" CBOR item:

   section-lengths = [* (section-name: tstr, length: uint) ],

   This field lists the named sections in the bundle in the order they
   appear, with each section name followed by the length in bytes of the
   corresponding CBOR item in the "sections" array.  This allows a
   random-access parser (Section 3) to jump directly to the section it
   needs.  This specification defines the following sections:

   *  ""index"" (Section 4.2.1)

   *  ""critical"" (Section 4.2.2)

   *  ""responses"" (Section 4.3)

   Future specifications can register new section names as described in
   Section 6.2, in order to extend the format without incrementing its
   version number.

   The ""responses"" section MUST appear after the other three sections
   defined here, and parsers MUST NOT load any data if that is not the
   case.

   The "sections" array contains the sections' content.  The length of
   this array MUST be exactly half the length of the "section-lengths"
   array, and parsers MUST NOT load any data if that is not the case.

   The bundle MUST contain the ""index"" and ""responses"" sections.
   All other sections are optional.

4.2.1.  The index section

   index = {* whatwg-url => [ location-in-responses ] }
   location-in-responses = (offset: uint, length: uint)

   The ""index"" section defines the set of HTTP representations in the
   bundle and identifies their locations in the ""responses"" section.
   It consists of a CBOR map whose keys are the URLs of the
   representations in the bundle (Section 2.2).  The value of an index
   entry is an offset/length pair.  The offset is relative to the start
   of the ""responses"" section, with an offset of 0 referring to the
   head of the CBOR "responses" array itself.  The length is the length
   in bytes of the "response" CBOR item holding this representation
   (Section 4.3).

4.2.2.  The critical section

   critical = [*tstr]

   The "critical" section consists of the names of sections of the
   bundle that the client needs to understand in order to load the
   bundle correctly.  Other sections are assumed to be optional.

   If the client has not implemented a section named by one of the items
   in this list, the client MUST fail to parse the bundle as a whole.

4.3.  Responses

   responses = [*response]
   response = [headers: bstr .cbor headers, payload: bstr]
   headers = {* bstr => bstr}

   The "responses" section holds the HTTP responses that represent the
   HTTP representations in the bundle.  It consists of a CBOR array of
   responses, each of which is pointed to by one or more entries in the
   "index" section (Section 4.2.1).

   The length of the "headers" byte string in a response MUST be less
   than 524288 (512*1024) bytes, and recipients MUST fail to load a
   response with longer headers.

   When receiving a bundle in a stream, the recipient MAY process the
   headers before the payload has been received and MAY start processing
   the beginning of the payload before the end of the payload has been
   received.

   The keys of the headers map MUST consist of lowercase ASCII as
   described in Section 8.1.2 of [RFC7540].  Response pseudo-headers
   (Section 8.1.2.4 of [RFC7540] are included in this headers map.

   Each response's headers MUST include a ":status" pseudo-header with
   exactly 3 ASCII decimal digits and MUST NOT include any other pseudo-
   headers.

   If a response's payload is not empty, its headers MUST include a
   "Content-Type" header (Section 8.3 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics]).
   The client MUST interpret the following payload as this specified
   media type instead of trying to sniff a media type from the bytes of
   the payload, for example by appending an artificial "X-Content-Type-
   Options: nosniff" header field ([FETCH]) to downstream protocols.

4.4.  Serving constraints

   When served over HTTP, a response containing an "application/
   webbundle" payload MUST include at least the following response
   header fields, to reduce content sniffing vulnerabilities
   (Section 5.2):

   *  Content-Type: application/webbundle

   *  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Version skew

   Bundles currently have no mechanism for ensuring that any signed
   exchanges they contain constitute a consistent version of those
   resources.  Even if a website never has a security vulnerability when
   resources are fetched at a single time, an attacker might be able to
   combine a set of resources pulled from different versions of the
   website to build a vulnerable site.  While the vulnerable site could
   have occurred by chance on a client's machine due to normal HTTP
   caching, bundling allows an attacker to guarantee that it happens.
   Future work in this specification might allow a bundle to constrain
   its resources to come from a consistent version.

5.2.  Content sniffing

   While modern browsers tend to trust the "Content-Type" header sent
   with a resource, especially when accompanied by "X-Content-Type-
   Options: nosniff", plugins will sometimes search for executable
   content buried inside a resource and execute it in the context of the
   origin that served the resource, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.  For
   example, some PDF reader plugins look for "%PDF" anywhere in the
   first 1kB and execute the code that follows it.

   The "application/webbundle" format defined above includes URLs and
   request headers early in the format, which an attacker could use to
   cause these plugins to sniff a bad content type.

   To avoid vulnerabilities, in addition to the response header
   requirements in Section 4.4, servers are advised to only serve an
   "application/webbundle" resource from a domain if it would also be
   safe for that domain to serve the bundle's content directly, and to
   follow at least one of the following strategies:

   1.  Only serve bundles from dedicated domains that don't have access
       to sensitive cookies or user storage.

   2.  Generate bundles "offline", that is, in response to a trusted
       author submitting content or existing signatures reaching a
       certain age, rather than in response to untrusted-reader queries.

   3.  Do all of:

       1.  If the bundle's contained URLs (e.g. in the index) are
           derived from the request for the bundle, percent-encode
           (https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encode) ([URL]) any
           bytes that are greater than 0x7E or are not URL code points
           (https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-code-points) ([URL]) in
           these URLs.  It is particularly important to make sure no
           unescaped nulls (0x00) or angle brackets (0x3C and 0x3E)
           appear.

       2.  Similarly, if the request headers for any contained resource
           are based on the headers sent while requesting the bundle,
           only include request header field names *and values* that
           appear in a static allowlist.  Keep the set of allowed
           request header fields smaller than 24 elements to prevent
           attackers from controlling a whole CBOR length byte.

       3.  Restrict the number of items a request can direct the server
           to include in a bundle to less than 12, again to prevent
           attackers from controlling a whole CBOR length byte.

       4.  Do not reflect request header fields into the set of response
           headers.

   If the server serves responses that are written by a potential
   attacker but then escaped, the "application/webbundle" format allows
   the attacker to use the length of the response to control a few bytes
   before the start of the response.  Any existing mechanisms that
   prevent polyglot documents probably keep working in the face of this
   new attack, but we don't have a guarantee of that.

   To encourage servers to include the "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff"
   header field, clients SHOULD reject bundles served without it.

6.  IANA considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA is requested to register the MIME media type
   ([IANA.media-types]) for web bundles, application/webbundle, as
   follows:

   *  Type name: application

   *  Subtype name: webbundle

   *  Required parameters:

      -  v: A string denoting the version of the file format.
         ([RFC5234] ABNF: "version = 1*(DIGIT/%x61-7A)") The version
         defined in this specification is "1".

         Note: RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS NOTE; Implementations of
         drafts of this specification MUST NOT use simple integers to
         describe their versions, and MUST instead define
         implementation-specific strings to identify which draft is
         implemented.

   *  Optional parameters: N/A

   *  Encoding considerations: binary

   *  Security considerations: See Section 5 of this document.

   *  Interoperability considerations: N/A

   *  Published specification: This document

   *  Applications that use this media type: None yet, but it is
      expected that web browsers will use this format.

   *  Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

   *  Additional information:

      -  Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A

      -  Magic number(s): 86 48 F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6

      -  File extension(s): .wbn

      -  Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

   *  Person & email address to contact for further information: See the
      Author's Address section of this specification.

   *  Intended usage: COMMON

   *  Restrictions on usage: N/A

   *  Author: See the Author's Address section of this specification.

   *  Change controller: The IESG iesg@ietf.org (mailto:iesg@ietf.org)

   *  Provisional registration?  Yes.

6.2.  Web Bundle Section Name Registry

   IANA is directed to create a new registry with the following
   attributes:

   Name: Web Bundle Section Names

   Review Process: Specification Required

   Initial Assignments:

                     +==============+===============+
                     | Section Name | Specification |
                     +==============+===============+
                     | "index"      | Section 4.2.1 |
                     +--------------+---------------+
                     | "critical"   | Section 4.2.2 |
                     +--------------+---------------+
                     | "responses"  | Section 4.3   |
                     +--------------+---------------+

                                 Table 1

   Requirements on new assignments:

   Section Names MUST be encoded in UTF-8.

   A section's specification MAY say that, if it is present, another
   section is not processed.

Appendix A.  Web bundle Format

   This appendix summarises the Web bundle format.

   Web bundles are defined in CDDL ([CDDL]), a language for expressing
   grammars over CBOR ([CBORbis]) binary data formats.  Please refer to
   ([CDDL]) and ([CBORbis]) for the exact definition of the types used
   in this specification.

   To maintain compatibility across versions and environments, a Web
   bundle begins with a magic number (file signature) followed by a
   version number, and ends with the bundle's length.  The version
   number is expected to not change, except as a last resort.

   At the top level of their binary format, Web bundles are defined as a
   series of named sections, each with a length.  The "section-lengths"
   field contains a table of contents, and the sections are found in the
   main "sections" field.

   The bundle MUST contain the ""index"" and ""responses"" sections.
   All other sections are optional.

   Even though this format starts out with just three core sections, its
   architecture ensures that the format is extensible.  Over time, more
   sections could be defined and used without causing a breaking change.
   Other binary formats such as WebAssembly bytecode
   (https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/
   modules.html#sections) have made a similar design decision.

A.1.  Bundle format

A.1.1.  Type: "bundle"

    +=================+=======+==========+===========================+

    +-----------------+-------+----------+---------------------------+
    | sections        | array | variable | see _core sections_       |
    |                 |       |          | (Appendix A.2)            |
    +-----------------+-------+----------+---------------------------+
    | length          | bytes | 64 bits  | the length of the bundle  |
    |                 |       |          | in bytes                  |
    +-----------------+-------+----------+---------------------------+

                                 Table 2

   CDDL spec:

   webbundle = [
     magic: h'F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6',
     version: bytes .size 4,
     section-lengths: bytes .cbor section-lengths,
     sections: [* any ],
     length: bytes .size 8, ; Big-endian number of bytes in the bundle.
   ]

   Note: the basic type "bytes" (alternatively named "bstr"), defined as
   Major type 2 in the [CBORbis] specification, represents a byte
   string.

A.1.2.  Type: "section-length"

       +==============+======+==========+=========================+
       | name         | type | size     | description             |
       +==============+======+==========+=========================+
       | section-name | tstr | variable | The name of the section |
       +--------------+------+----------+-------------------------+
       | length       | uint | variable | The length of the       |
       |              |      |          | section in bytes        |
       +--------------+------+----------+-------------------------+

                                 Table 3

   CDDL spec:

   section-lengths = [* (section-name: tstr, length: uint) ]

   Note: the basic type "tstr", defined as Major type 3 in the [CBORbis]
   specification, represents a text string encoded as UTF-8.

A.2.  Core sections

A.2.1.  The "index" section

   The "index" section maps URLs ([URL]) to offset/length pairs in the
   "responses" (Appendix A.2.3) section.

A.2.1.1.  Type: "index"

        +=======+=======================+==========+=============+
        | name  | type                  | size     | description |
        +=======+=======================+==========+=============+
        | index | map (whatwg-url       | variable | A map from  |
        |       | (Appendix A.2.1.2) => |          | a URL to a  |
        |       | location-in-responses |          | location    |
        |       | (Appendix A.2.1.3))   |          |             |
        +-------+-----------------------+----------+-------------+

                                 Table 4

A.2.1.2.  Type: "whatwg-url"

     +============+======+==========+===============================+
     | name       | type | size     | description                   |
     +============+======+==========+===============================+
     | whatwg-url | tstr | variable | A URL stored as a text string |
     +------------+------+----------+-------------------------------+

                                 Table 5

A.2.1.3.  Type: "location-in-responses"

       +========+======+==========+================================+
       | name   | type | size     | description                    |
       +========+======+==========+================================+
       | offset | uint | variable | An offset within the responses |
       |        |      |          | (Appendix A.2.3) section       |
       +--------+------+----------+--------------------------------+
       | length | uint | variable | The size of the response in    |
       |        |      |          | bytes                          |
       +--------+------+----------+--------------------------------+

                                  Table 6

   CDDL spec:

   index = {* whatwg-url => [ location-in-responses ] }
   whatwg-url = tstr
   location-in-responses = (offset: uint, length: uint)

   Note: the basic type "uint", defined as Major type 0 in the [CBORbis]
   specification, represents an unsigned integer.

A.2.2.  The "critical" section

   The "critical" section contains the names of additional sections of
   the bundle that the client needs to understand in order to load the
   bundle correctly.  The rest of the sections are assumed to be
   optional.  If the client has not implemented a section named by one
   of the items in this list, the client MUST fail to parse the bundle
   as a whole.

   The "critical" section itself is optional.

   CDDL spec:

   critical = [*tstr]

A.2.3.  The "responses" section

   The "responses" section contains an array of HTTP responses ([HTTP]).
   Each response contains the response headers and the response body.

A.2.3.1.  Type: "response"

     +=========+=============+==========+===========================+
     | name    | type        | size     | description               |
     +=========+=============+==========+===========================+
     | headers | map ("bstr" | variable | A map of field name to    |
     |         | => "bstr")  |          | field value               |
     +---------+-------------+----------+---------------------------+
     | payload | bstr        | variable | The content of the HTTP   |
     |         |             |          | response as a byte string |
     +---------+-------------+----------+---------------------------+

                                 Table 7

   CDDL spec:

   responses = [*response]
   response = [headers: bstr .cbor headers, payload: bstr]
   headers = {* bstr => bstr}

   *  Provisionally register application/webbundle.

   draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges-01

   *  Include only section lengths in the section index, requiring
      sections to be listed in order.

   *  Have the "index" section map URLs to sets of responses negotiated
      using the Variants system ([I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants]).

   *  Require the "manifest" to be embedded into the bundle.

   *  Add a content sniffing security consideration.

   *  Add a version string to the format and its mime type.

   *  Add a fallback URL in a fixed location in the format, and use that
      fallback URL as the primary URL of the bundle.

   *  Add a "signatures" section to let authorities (like domain-trusted
      X.509 certificates) vouch for subsets of a bundle.

   *  Use the CBORbis "deterministic encoding" requirements instead of
      "canonicalization" requirements.
